# LeanForge-LEAN

This repository contains a fork of the [LEAN Algorithmic Trading Engine](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean) created by QuantConnect, modified to work with LeanForge.

The primary goal of this fork is to remove cloud dependencies and provide a fully local experience for algorithmic trading using the LEAN engine.

## About LEAN

LEAN is an open-source algorithmic trading engine built by QuantConnect (https://www.quantconnect.com) that allows you to design, test, and deploy trading algorithms. 

## LeanForge Modifications

LeanForge is creating a modified version of LEAN that:

1. Removes QuantConnect cloud dependencies
2. Implements local authentication
3. Uses local data sources
4. Removes cloud logging and analytics
5. Provides a standalone interface for LEAN
